## About The Project

This project was created to solve the problems brought by the real estate trade system used today. It aimed to eliminate the need for intermediaries and security problems.

Smart contracts have been used as a solution to these problems. Title deeds are created as nft and are put up for sale on the marketplace. After logging in with the user's google account, he/she can buy/sell. In this part, nextAuht is used.

Users can link their metamask wallets thanks to wagmi. In addition, the property information that users want to offer for sale is kept with ipfs.
